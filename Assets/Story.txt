A new fungi has evolved. This fungus will attach itself to every creature it touches. The fungus, takes over the eyes of it's host, and eat them out. This fungus is called the Rotting Liquor Spore, because it looks like a black goo. Infected creatures are called darkasts. Darkasts will lower their head to gain it's victim's trust, then attack them when the victim lowers it's guard. You can avoid being eaten by lowering your head. Do not let the darkasts see your eyes.
